# Configure Concurrent User Access to the Application

Tenant administrator can allow or restrict user access to an application from one or more browsers or devices.



## Context

With the concurrent user access option, you as a tenant administrator can configure the system so that based on the requirements the application can allow or restrict multiple sign-ins by one and the same user.

The concurrent access offers three options:

-   **Allow**

    No restrictions are applied. The user can sign in from multiple devices and browsers. This is the default setting.

-   **Warning**
    This warns the user so they sign in from only one device or browser at a time. If other sessions exist, the user receives a message and will have the option to         terminate the other session and sign out. (The other sessions will not terminate automatically if you choose to sign in and continue to the new session)
   
-   **Error**

    The user can sign in from only one device or browser at a time. When the user try to sign in from another device or browser, they see an error message.
